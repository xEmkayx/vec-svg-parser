# Parse .vec files to .svg images
Render images from .vec files created by programs like "Pictures by PC" or "isycam". 
Syntax is limited to these languages.
If you're a student that has to use these programs in school but has no access to those 
at home, you can simply parse your code with this script and see the result.
