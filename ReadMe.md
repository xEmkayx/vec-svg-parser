# Parse .vec files to .svg images
Render images from .vec files created by programs like "Pictures by PC" or "isycam". 
Syntax is limited to these languages.
If you're a student that has to use these programs in school but has no access to those 
at home, you can simply parse your code with this script and see the result.

# How to use
Start the GUI/Webgui and select the input image and output image filename and hit submit. The images are saved
to the '/static/IMG/' folder
